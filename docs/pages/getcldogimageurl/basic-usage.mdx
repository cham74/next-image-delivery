# Getting Started with getCldOgImageUrl

The getCldOgImageUrl function helps you easily generate Social Card image URLs (Open Graph Images) using Cloudinary.

This URL can be then used when defining metadata for your page within Next.js.

<Callout emoji={false} type="info">
  Working inside of the Pages router? Check out the [CldOgImage component](/cldogimage/).
</Callout>

## Basic Usage

getCldOgImageUrl makes it convenient to create Social Card URLs out-of-the-box.

The only needed prop is `src`:

<HeaderImage>
  <CldImage
    src={getCldOgImageUrl({
      src: `${process.env.IMAGES_DIRECTORY}/galaxy`
    })}
    width="1200"
    height="627"
    sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 50vw"
    alt=""
    preserveTransformations
  />
</HeaderImage>

> Note: The image above is rendered using the [CldImage component](/cldimage/) for preview only.

<CodeBlock>
  ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
  import { getCldOgImageUrl } from 'next-cloudinary';

  const url = getCldOgImageUrl({
    src: '<Public ID>'
  });
  ```
</CodeBlock>

The function simply returns a URL for the image public ID provided including default configurations
including a standard width and height.

To use this in a Next.js app with the App Router, you would then configure it with your Metadata object or generate function:

<CodeBlock>
  ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
  import { Metadata } from 'next';
  import { getCldOgImageUrl } from 'next-cloudinary';

  const url = getCldOgImageUrl({
    src: '<Public ID>'
  });

  export const metadata: Metadata = {
    openGraph: {
      images: [
        {
          width: 1200,
          height: 627,
          url
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeBlock>

getCldOgImageUrl is a deritive of getCldImageUrl meaning it generally has the same API, but provides
a few defaults for Open Graph images like sizes.

## Image Size

By default, the image canvas is based upon 2400x1254, but resized down to 1200x627, meaning, you can
design the image as if it were a 2400x1254 image, but the resulting image will be sized down to 1200x627
to avoid an overly large image.

627 (with a canvas of 1254) is used to satisfy the 1.91:1 ratio requirement and minimum size
[requirement from linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a521928/make-your-website-shareable-on-linkedin).

This two-step sizing is done to help maintain a consistent canvas size when designing elements such as
overlays that require position and sizing relative to the original image.

You can use the `width` and the `height` to control the canvas and `widthResize` to change the final size the image is scaled to.

The height is ultimately calculated using the `width` value and the `widthResize` values to maintain the correct ratio.

## Image Format

While Cloudinary's `f_auto` parameter ([format of auto](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_optimization#how_to_optimize_image_format)) is great for websites and mobile apps, having more control over the format helps to reduce initial encoding time, which is more critical for a social network to recognize the image and load it on first share.

The safe default format for most use cases is then jpg, as webp does not have broad support (likely nor does AVIF).

If you have the control in your application to produce multiple image sources, such has having a separate `og:image` and `twitter:image`, you can generate two (or more) URLs to produce as optimized a format as you can for the platform:

<CodeBlock>
  ```jsx copy showLineNumbers
  import { Metadata } from 'next';
  import { getCldOgImageUrl } from 'next-cloudinary';

  const ogImageUrl = getCldOgImageUrl({
    ...options,
    format: 'jpg',
  });

  const twitterImageUrl = getCldOgImageUrl({
    ...options,
    format: 'webp',
  });

  export const metadata: Metadata = {
    openGraph: {
      images: [
        {
          width: 1200,
          height: 627,
          url: ogImageUrl
        }
      ]
    },
    twitter: {
      images: [twitterImageUrl],
    },
  }
  ```
</CodeBlock>
